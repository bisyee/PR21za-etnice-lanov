I have to tweak the map a bit so it shows you data for a specific year (to make it more interactive) and research how I can implement Bayes for our data.
We have to graph/find patterns on the new dataframe.
We have to make the graphed data for the 2nd and 3rd parts are correct (the data isn't for individual patients so it's easy to mess up)
