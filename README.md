## Current findings
So far we've looked at data pertaining to the number of hospitalizations in Slovenia by year based on diagnosis, gender, and region. We started off by trying to find any 
correlations between some of the attributes. Since we didn't find anything important we decided to look for the 5 diagnoses that resulted in the highest number of
hospital occupancy. These ended up being: {'Bolezni se훾il in spolovil (N00-N99)': 735056, 'Bolezni prebavil (K00-K93)': 955578, 'Bolezni dihal (J00-J99)': 962024, 
'Neoplazme (C00-D48)': 1234724, 'Bolezni obto훾il (I00-I99)': 1376298}. We wanted to learn more about these types of diseases so we decided to write a function that would
graph the number of people hospitalized for a given diagnosis. We decided to omit people who identify as non-binary and those who did not disclose their gender because
their number was very low, rendering them statistically insignificant. We noticed that certain diagnoses are more common among men (Bolezni prebavil, Bolezni dihal, 
Bolezni obto훾il), whereas Bolezni se훾il in spolovil are more common among women and Neoplazme are about the same for both genders. Overall, women required more hospital care
than men (but this is most likely due to the fact that women outnumber men in Slovenia); the most **dangerous** (i.e. resulting in the need for more hospital care) diagnoses are
more common with men. Some of these can be explained, for instance, the number of respiratory problems (Bolezni dihal (J00-J99)) could be explained by the fact that there
are more male spokers than female ones [Data found here](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/312046/Fact-Sheet-tobacco-control-Slovenia.pdf). 
We made a comparison of the occupancy between the statistical regions and we can see that the region "Osrednjoslovenska" is the most occupied, after it come "Podravska" 
and "Savinjska". The least occupied is the statistical region "Tujina" which says that most of the Slovenian people are treated in Slovenian hospitals. After normalizing the data
we found out that Pomurska, Zasavska and Koroska had the highest number of hospitalizations for their population size.
